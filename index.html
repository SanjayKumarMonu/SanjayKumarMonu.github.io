	<ol>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the following format. Go to the editor
			Output : Today is : Friday. 
			Current time is : 4 PM : 50 : 22</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to print the contents of the current window.</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to get the current date.
			Expected Output : mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7. Go to the editor</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to rotate the string 'w3resource' in right direction by periodically removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front.</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to determine whether a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to find 1st January is being a Sunday between 2014 and 2050.</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program where the program takes a random integer between 1 to 10, the user is then prompted to input a guess number. If the user input matches with guess number, the program will display a message "Good Work" otherwise display a message "Not matched".</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to calculate days left until next Christmas.</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to calculate multiplication and division of two numbers (input from user).</li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. Go to the editor
			[ Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ] 
			Expected Output : 
			60°C is 140 °F
			45°F is 7.222222222222222°C </li>
		<li>Write a JavaScript program to get the website URL (loading page).</li>


		Question 1

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   int n;
   for(n = 7; n!=0; n--)
     printf("n = %d", n--);
   getchar();
   return 0;
}
Output:Above program goes in infinite loop because n is never zero when loop condition (n != 0) is checked.

Question 2

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("%x", -1<<1);
   getchar();
   return 0;
}
Output is dependent on the compiler. For 32 bit compiler it would be fffffffe and for 16 bit it would be fffe.

Question 3

# include <stdio.h>
# define scanf  "%s Geeks For Geeks "
main()
{
   printf(scanf, scanf);
   getchar();
   return 0;
}
Output: %s Geeks For Geeks Geeks For Geeks
Explanation: After pre-processing phase of compilation, printf statement will become.

   printf("%s Geeks For Geeks ",  "%s Geeks For Geeks ");
Now you can easily guess why output is %s Geeks For Geeks Geeks For Geeks.

Question 4

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
enum {false, true};
int main()
{
   int i = 1;
   do
   {
      printf("%d\n", i);
      i++;
      if (i < 15)
        continue;
   } while (false);

   getchar();
   return 0;
}
Output: 1
Explanation: The do wile loop checks condition after each iteration. So after continue statement, control transfers to the statement while(false). Since the condition is false ‘i’ is printed only once.

Now try below program.

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
enum {false, true};
int main()
{
   int i = 1;
   do
   {
     printf("%d\n", i);
     i++;
     if (i < 15)
       break;
     } while (true);

     getchar();
     return 0;
}
Question 5

char *getString()
{
   char *str = "Nice test for strings";
   return str;
}

int main()
{
   printf("%s", getString());
   getchar();
   return 0;
}
Output: “Nice test for strings”
The above program works because string constants are stored in Data Section (not in Stack Section). So, when getString returns *str is not lost.
